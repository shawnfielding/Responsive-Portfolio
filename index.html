				<p>People are smart and people are dumb.  We can figure out patterns in the fundamental building blocks of the universe and use them to our advantage, but we can't find our wallet.</p><br>
				<p>It is my belief that the line between the two is the quality of the interface.  It is how information is delivered and where people turn it into knowledge. Whether it be a memo from your boss, the door to your house or the website you are researching on, these interfaces are the primary difference between you getting it, not getting it, or getting it wrong.</p><br>
				<p>This is the reason I have become a developer.  I want to work specifically on creating better interfaces.  I come from a library and content management background, which focussed on storage and classification of information.  It got boring.  I now want to be on that edge of where information becomes knowledge (or not), and I want to be the one who influences which way it goes.</p>
